This is called the \"convex hull.\"  Imagine a game of darts, in which you throw some number n of darts at a board.  Then imagine placing a rubber band around all those darts, and computing the area the rubber band. I was interested in computing the area within that rubber band. ![\"Rubber Banding\" a goup of points](ConvexHull.svg)  The result was roughly a hundred lines of Python code that was a lot of fun to write, that didn't do anything useful, but that let me think through some interesting problems about randomness and about optimization.\n",

The direction parameter chooses which test to use; it is negative for points in the upper part of the polygon, positive for points in the lower part.  (If point i is in the upper part, its index must be less than the index of the rightmost point, so i - mxi is negative.)  If `below_above()` returns True, the point is on the interior, so we discard it.  \n",

    "The \"inner,\" more jagged path is the original set of random points, converted into a clockwise polygon.  The outerpath is the convex hull.  We've eliminated all the interior points, leaving only the points on the hull. If you want to get a feel for how the algorithm works, try modifying make_convex().  Change the line that reads `unchanged = False` to read `pass`, then re-run the code.  With this modification, make_convex() will only make one pass through the points.  You should be able to look at the result and understand which points were eliminated, which were kept, and why.  And after the first pass, you should see some interior points that weren't eliminated.  Why?   "
   ]
  },
  {
   "cell_type": "markdown",
   "metadata": {},
   "source": [
    "That's pretty much it. Writing the code is arguably less interesting than thinking about what it means.  First, how quickly does the convex hull grow as the number of points increases? Quite slowly.  A convex hull of a million random points is usually only 25 or 30 points.  That makes sense: most of the points are in the interior of the bounding polygon. Would we see the same slow growth with a Gaussian distribution?  I haven't tried it, but I bet we would.  (Don't do this on O'Reilly's server, but feel free to download the notebook and try it on your laptop.)\n",
    "\n",
    "Second, how fast is this code?  Reasonably fast on a laptop: finding the hull of a million points takes roughly 10 seconds.  But what's more important than speed is how the time grows as the number of points increases.  As I've presented it, the time grows as N log(N).  Here's a hand-waving argument for why: We have to process each point, and decide whether it's in the interior or exterior.  That's N, where N is the number of points.  And the number of times we go through the loop appears to (massive handwaving) increase as the log of N. \n",
    "\n",
    "But that wasn't my first version, which increased as N^2 log(N). And that's important.  The first version implemented the algorithm exactly as I described it: when we found a point in the interior, that point was deleted from the polygon.  So there were a lot of calls to Python's `del()` function.  `del()` is a rather odd animal that I won't go into, but regardless of how you delete points from a list, you'll come up against an immovable obstacle.  The time it takes to delete a point from a list is proportional to the length of the list.  So, if we have N points, and we're going to delete almost all of them, the time it takes will be proportional to N squared.  And we still have to take into account the log(n) factor, because the first trip through the polygon doesn't find all the interior points.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's defer the final solution for a moment.  My second (not so good) solution was fairly interesting, and might be useful for some other problems.  I observed that finding the hull of a million points took a long time, but finding the hull of 1000 points was very quick.  And the hull of a thousand points only had 10 or 15 points in it.  So I tried finding the hull 1000 points at a time: do the first 1000 points, end up with 15 points, add the next 1000 points, end up with 15 points again, and so on.  That actually worked quite well: it's almost competitive with the final N log(N) algorithm, for a million points or so.  The time still grows as N^2 log(N), so it's a disaster for really huge problems, like 100 million points.  But it was surprisingly good for a million points or so, and it's an idea I'll keep around; I may eventually find a problem where it's useful.  \n",
    "\n",
    "- comment - optimal grouping, if anyone cared, turns out to be about 2500 points.  Doesn't appear to depend on the size of the problem.  Probably depends strongly on the characteristics of your computer.\n",
    "\n",
    "The final solution came about as an anticlimax.  I broke down and looked up [Convex Hull on Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convex_hull), which told me that the algorithm can be implemented in N log(N) time.  I knew I hadn't gotten there, but after a little thought, I said \"Oh. Rather than deleting elements from the interior, build a new list from elements on the exterior:  appending to a list is really fast.\"  Problem solved.\n",
    "\n",
    "- question - Is it worth presenting this material?  Can it done in a better way than just writing about it?  I really don't want to go back to that old code. "

    "make_convex() has an outer `while` loop surrounding the loop that actually inspects and saves the interior points.  Every pass through the list will eliminate roughly 90% of the interior points, but not all of them; you have to keep working through the list until you've eliminated everything on the interior.  It's a useful exercise to add some code to plot the first few polygons you get from this process.  Work through the algorithm in your head until you understand why that outer loop is necessary.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Once you've done that, here's the big question: is it possible to rewrite make_convex() to eliminate that outer loop?  And if you do so, will it be any faster than my version?  \n",
    "\n",
    "- comment - my answer: It's possible to rewrite make_convex() without the outer loop, so that you only visit each point once.  There's a cost: you will need to introduce an even deeper loop: you'll end up with a nested loop either way.  Will it be faster?  I don't think it will be; I gave up when I convinced myself that eliminating the outer loop, so you only made one pass through the list of points, wouldn't save much, would add a lot of complexity, and would at best be marginally faster.\n",
    "\n",
    "- more comment - lesson in optimizing the wrong thing: I was trying to get rid of a log(n) when there was an n^2 staring me in the face (changing from deleting interior points to saving exterior points).  Don't do that.\n",

If you find yourself cutting and pasting code, you're probably doing something wrong.  At best, you're creating code that's hard to maintain: if you find a bug in the cut-paste section, you have to fix it everywhere you pasted it. "

    "Instead of a single isInterior() function, the first version of this program had two functions: isAbove() and isBelow().  They figured out whether a point was above or below the line passing through two other points.  As you can imagine, these functions were fairly similar, and were a good example of cut-paste code.  The only difference might have been between < and > in one if statement.  So, thinking of the DRY principle, and my own experience that cut-paste programming leads to misery, I combined isAbove() and isBelow() into a single isInterior()."
